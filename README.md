'Split-It': An app born out of my commitment to Food Talk, my college club for fellow food enthusiasts at Baruch.

'Split-It': A project designed exclusively for Food Talk, my college club dedicated to food enthusiasts at Baruch. This app simplifies and ensures fair bill settlements within sizable groups. By distributing the bill based on individual orders, including tax and tip calculations, the app ensures a balanced division of expenses. Despite its simplicity, 'Split-It' achieves its purpose effectively and elegantly.

Here is the glimpse of the App's UI. Visit the folder "View The App's UI" for detailed visuals
